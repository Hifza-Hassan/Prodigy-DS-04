This code performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews using the NLTK library's VADER sentiment analysis tool. After installing the necessary libraries and downloading the required datasets, the code initializes the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer and loads the movie reviews dataset from NLTK. It processes the reviews into a DataFrame, computes sentiment scores for each review, and categorizes them as 'Positive' or 'Negative' based on the scores. The code then visualizes the sentiment distribution using a count plot and a histogram of sentiment scores, and further explores the distribution of positive and negative reviews across different movie categories. Finally, it displays the first few records of the analyzed dataset, providing insights into the sentiment analysis results.
